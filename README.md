> [!IMPORTANT] 
>  How to set up ?

To begin with, your need to download NodeJS at [this link](https://nodejs.org/en) and install it <br>
After install, open your terminal and type <br>
`node -v`<br>
If you see the result like <br>
`v22.4.0`<br>
That means you have installed successfully<br>

Next, you need to install JDK (Java Development Kit).
Go to this [link](https://download.oracle.com/java/22/latest/jdk-22_windows-x64_bin.exe ) to download <br>
> [!CAUTION]
> After you have set up jdk, you need to set path variable<br>

On Windows, search  
> Edit the system enviroment variables <br>

Select 
>Enviroment Variables

Find
> `Path` and select `Edit`

Click
> `New` and it will create a new row for you

>  Enter the path to your JDK bin directory (Ex: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk<version>\bin).

Mine is  `D:\java\jdk-19\bin`

Finally, open your terminal and type `java --version`. If it shows something like `java 19.0.1 2022-10-18`, you have set up jdk successfully
